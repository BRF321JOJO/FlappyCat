If unmute while Qazi from Whynot is in circular motion, possibility will unmute while Qazi off left side of screen...

//  int counter for code not every frame

//  int counter = 0;
//  counter++;
    //Happens every x frames
//  if (counter % x == 0)
//  {*Code that runs*}


//Gdx.input.isKeyPressed(Input.Keys.SPACE)
        //This allows holding down key to take action, constantly
        //If isKeyJustPressed is used instead, then it only works each time it's pressed. Prevents holding down key to allow action.

Circular motion in java is done easily using the math functions (sine and cosine)
 circleangle += 45;
 posx += (float) (a * Math.sin(Math.toRadians(circleangle)));
 posy += (float) (b * Math.cos(Math.toRadians(circleangle)));

 This changes the positions of an object according to sine and cosine and a circular angle which increases by a value every time it updates.
 The circle angle value can be any value increase, which will change the radius of the rotation.
 The circular rotation speed can be changed by multiplying the circleangle variable by a constant.
 *Note: If the Math.toRadians or Math.toDegrees will swap what value the trigonometric values take in. (default radians)
 *Note: Sine and cosine values will increase infinitely in range. Therefore, to get circular motion which stays in place,
 the value of the circle angle needs to be reset each time.
