//  int counter for code not every frame

//  int counter = 0;
//  counter++;
    //Happens every x frames
//  if (counter % x == 0)
//  {*Code that runs*}


//Gdx.input.isKeyPressed(Input.Keys.SPACE)
        //This allows holding down key to take action, constantly
        //If isKeyJustPressed is used instead, then it only works each time it's pressed. Prevents holding down key to allow action.
