To-do:

Add gifs (to pause screen)

Make it so hitting pipes causes high score message to appear.
Seems to be caused by CPlayer.dead not triggering as true when hit pipe as highscore appears when die out of bounds.

//  int counter for code not every frame

//  int counter = 0;
//  counter++;
    //Happens every x frames
//  if (counter % x == 0)
//  {*Code that runs*}


//Gdx.input.isKeyPressed(Input.Keys.SPACE)
        //This allows holding down key to take action, constantly
        //If isKeyJustPressed is used instead, then it only works each time it's pressed. Prevents holding down key to allow action.


Circular motion in java is done using the math functions (sine and cosine)
 circleangle += c;
 posx += (float) (a * Math.sin(circleangle));
 posy += (float) (b * Math.cos(circleangle));

 - Changes the positions of an object according to sine and cosine and a circular angle which increases by a value every update.
 - The circular angle determines the values the circle takes. If incorrect, the circle will move slowly or quickly in a direction.
        EX: Circle angle = 1; Moves left slowly
        *Note: Must be defined as double if using radians/pi
 - The distance in the x and y axis is determined by a,b values. A = B for circle.

 *Note: Math.toRadians or Math.toDegrees will swap what value the trigonometric values take in. (Default radians)
 *Note: Sine and cosine values will increase infinitely in range. Therefore, the value of the circle angle can be reset to 0.
 *Note: When reset, cannot go from 360 then to 0 or 2pi then to 0. - This will repeat the 360/2pi value twice.
